DevOps is a group of systems or applications that seek to unit, facilitate and automate developement and operation tasks. 

Ansible (Configuration Management tool)
Released in 2012 by Michael Dettaan.

YAML is a date serilisation designed to be directly writable and readable by humans.

            In case you have to enable epel on centos 7


1. Create a new file called 'ansible.repo' in /etc/yum.repos.d
2. Copy the following content into it:

[Ansible]
name = ansible
baseurl = https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/rpm/release/epel-7-x86_64/
enabled = 1
gpgcheck = 0

3. Run 'yum update'
4. Install ansible (sudo yum install ansible)

           On aws rhel8
1.  install python
#yum install python2 -y

2.Next, we should setup alternatives for our Python2 commands to run using Python. Use the command below for both instances:

#alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python2

3.Now, you must install Python3-pip on the instance. Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage additional Python packages which are not part of the standard python library.

#yum -y install python2-pip

4.We wouldn’t be able to install Ansible as a root user here, because in RHEL 8, this operation is not allowed. So, we are going to create a new user and setup a password for it.

#useradd ansiblecontrol

#passwd ansiblecontrol
For the second instance, create a user named, “managedhost” and setup a password for it as well.

Once completed, we should add the user ‘ansiblecontrol’ to sudoers file for sudo access. Use the command below to do that.

#echo “ansiblecontrol ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL” >> /etc/sudoers

Similarly, repeat the above with the user “managedhost” in the second instance.

5.The control node, also referred to as Ansible Master, connects to the managed host using SSH. Though using key-based authentication is recommended, when you are at a learning stage, use password-based authentication.

Edit the sshd_config file in /etc/ssh directory using vi.

#vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Find the PasswordAuthentication string in that file and change the value against it to ‘yes’. Save and quit the file.

Reload sshd service using the command below:

#service sshd reload

Step 6:

In RHEL 8, Ansible cannot be installed as a root user. So, we are going to install Ansible after switching user to the one which we created earlier in Step 4. Use the commands provided below for the same.

#su ansiblecontrol

$pip3 install ansible — user



(le shell module applique aussi les simples command du bash et chaque module est en fonctiondes taches que nous voulons accomplir) 

          Execute Standard shell commands or AD-HOC commands in ansible
1. The ansible command modules (A module is a set of commands that can be pushed out to ansible clients by the ansible server)
The command module is used to execute regular shell commands by ansible.
Display the pwd of the ansible user in the AWS RHEL8 ansible client

$ansible aws -m command -a 'pwd'
-m = specify module
-a = add command

2. Have ansible display the content of /etc/hosts and the pwd of the ansible user of the aws server all at once

$ansible aws -m command -a 'cat /etc/hosts && pwd' (will fail because th command module is limited and will not execute option like thsis) 
The shell module will execute bashell commands without limitation

3. The ansible shell module (used to execute shell commands in ansible)

$ansible aws -m shell -a 'cat /etc/hosts && pwd'

4. Have ansible create a User account using the shell module in the aws client

$ansible aws -m shell  -a 'useradd -c "devops26" -m devops26'
(will fail because the ansible account does not have sudo rights to create the account)

$ansible aws -m shell  -a 'useradd -c "devops26" -m devops26' --become
--become (will grant sudo rights to the ansible command)
verify in the aws client
$cat /etc/passwd


5. The file module (used to create files and diectories)
Create file called file26 in the home of the aws ansible client server
$ansible aws -m file -a 'path=/home/ansible/file state=touch'
(state=touch means we are creating a file)
verify on aws client (always make sure we are logged to ansible account on the aws client)
$ls

Have ansible create a directory called dir26 in the ansible user home of the aws client
$ansible aws -m file -a 'path=/home/ansible/dir26 state=directory'
$ls -l (to verify in aws)
OR
$ansible aws -m shell -a 'mkdir dir26'

Have ansible create a directory calle class26aws in the aws client using the file module, with permission 777, owner = root of the group root

$ansible aws -m file -a 'path=/home/ansible/class26aws state=directory mode=777 owner=root group=root' --become
verify in aws
$ls
$ls -ld class26aws

Have ansible change the permission attribute of the file file26 in aws as follows; Mode=760, Owner=root, Group=root


$ansible aws -m file -a 'path=/home/ansible/file26 mode=file mode=760 owner=root group=root' --become
$ls -l file26 (to verify in aws)

Have ansible delete the file file26 from the ansible user home of the aws server
$ansible aws -m file -a 'path=/home/ansible/file26 state=absent'
(state=absent will delete a file or directory)
$ls to verify in aws

The copy module
1. Use the shell module to copy the /etc/passwd file to the home of the ansible user in aws
$ansible aws -m shell -a 'cp /etc/passwd .' (The shell command can be used for simple command)
$ls to verify in AWS)

2.Use the copy module to copy /etc/hosts to the home of ansible user in aws.

$ansible aws -m copy -a 'src=/etc/hosts dest=/home/ansible remote_src=yes'

(remote_src=yes copy operation should be performed entirely in remote client) this means /etc/hosts still on the remote aws and has to be coppied on the same aws server. (but $ansible aws -m copy -a 'src=/etc/hosts dest=/home/ansible' will make ansible server think that the operation is performed from ansible server to aws server)

3.Create a directory called diraws1 in the pwd of your ansible user in the ansible server.Have ansible transfer or copy the file to th ansible user's home in aws
$mkdir diraws1 (in ansible)

$ansible aws -m copy -a 'src=/home/ansible/diraws1 dest=/home/ansible'

$ansible aws -m copy -a 'src=/home/ansible/f26 dest=/home/ansible'
OR
$ansible aws -m copy -a 'src=f26 dest=/home/ansible'
$ls (to verify in aws)

4.Creating an account in the remote ansible client
create an account for Peter Tosh using standard using standars specs

$ansible aws -m shell -a 'useradd -c "Peter Tosh" -m ptosh' --become

5.Create a user account for Bob Marley using the user module
$ansible aws -m user -a 'name=bmarley comment="Bob Marley" home=/home/ansible25c group=ansible' --become

6.Create an account for Kevin Hart with standard specs and assign him the password:School1@12 using the ansible user module

A.Create the password hash or ecryption
$openssl passwd -crypt (and enter you desired password)

B.Create the account
$ansible aws -m user -a 'name=khart comment="Kevin Hart" password=mbDnBEZ0jkt76' --become 

Verify in client system
$cat /etc/passwd
$cat /etc/shadow (to verify hash)
Login as khart from putty and use the password

7.Install a package using ansible.
Use the yum module to install apache in the ansible client
$ansible aws -m yum -a 'name=httpd state=present' --become 
$yum list installed httpd (to verify on the client system)

B.Start the appache daemon
$ansible aws -m service -a 'name=httpd state=started' --become
$service httpd status (on client to verify)
$ansible aws -m shell -a 'chkconfig httpd on' --become (to make it permanent)

Install the firewalld package
$ansible aws -m ym -a /name=firewalld state=present' --become
$ansible aws -m shell -a 'chkconfig firewalld on' --become (to make it permanently enable the daemon)

D.Open up port 80 the firewall
$ansible aws -m shell -a 'firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http && firewall-cmd --reload' --become

E.Verify your apache server from a browser
http://<public ip of your RHEL8 Instance or apache sewrver>

Ansible is used for network automation
automate configuration application deployment
patching


1.On the ansible server we should create user account  (on the centos 7 server)
useradd -m ansible
password=Emeraude2289/

2.same thing for the AWS client server (create an ansible account)


3.login on ansible Server and generate public key (RSA KEY)
$su - ansible (to login into the ansible account!!!)
$ssh-keygen -t rsa   RSA ==>>Remote Security Authorization
create RSA KEY ==>> press enter 3 times

4.Transfert ssh key from ansible server to the ansible account in the aws server

$ssh-copy-id ansible@3.88.169.156

a.Check if we have passwordless access to the aws client
$ssh ansible@18.233.5.93
#vi /etc/sudoers and add the following line
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD ALL
5.Add our cloud aws to the inventory list (must go on the ansible server)

to check if we have ansible onthe system
$ansible --version
#su - ansible to login to the ansible account
$vi /etc/ansible/hosts
add the following lines:
[aws]
18.233.5.93 (ip adress of the aws server)

$ansible aws -m ping (verify telling ansible to bping server in this group or cloud)




      What is the netstat used for?
It is used to display incoming and outgoing TCP and UDP network connections,routingtable,NIC,and network statistics.
